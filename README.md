# antec-signalrgb-components
Some Antec components for SignalRGB. These are just what I have in my machine, so sorry if it's not comprehensive. Feel free to fork and add your own!

I used the [Nollie SignalRGB editor](https://github.com/qiangqiang101/Nollie-SignalRGB-Component-Editor) since I found Compgen limiting.
